# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In order to better inform future decisions, a summary ride-sharing dataframe and weekly ride report were organized by city type. By looking at how fares and drivers are distributed across the different city types, PyBer can make decisions on how their driver distrubutions can be managed to increase access and decrease expenses for both themselves and their riders. 

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
