# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In order to better inform future decisions, a summary ride-sharing dataframe and weekly ride report were organized by city type. By looking at how fares and drivers are distributed across the different city types, PyBer can make decisions on how their driver distributions can be managed to increase access and decrease expenses for both themselves and their riders.

As expected, there are more drivers, more rides, and the total fares are greatest for urban cities and least for rural cities, while suburban cities are strictly in the middle. Suburban cities have 5 times the total rides and total fares, 6 times the total drivers, but significantly lower average fares per rider and per driver compared to rural cities. This is to be expected because the populations are significantly lower in rural areas and the distances between locations is, on average, farther than those in suburban areas. The urban areas are even more extreme. There are 13 times as many rides, 30 times as many drivers, but only 10 times the total fares compared to rural cities. The average fare per ride is only 70% of that seen in rural cities, and the average fare per driver is only 30% of the rural driver average. While part of this is due to the shorter distances of each ride ( thus having a lower fare per ride ) and the increased population of urban areas, the disparity in total fares indicates that the total number of drivers is disproportionately large.
